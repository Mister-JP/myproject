        INTRODUCTIONBody area networks (BAN) using miniature sensors areexpected to
        allow for a lot of new applications of wirelesscommunication. They range from
        entertainment and automa-tion to health care or human interface devices. In
        many of theseapplications, the need for ultra-low power consumption isprioritary
        since network nodes are supplied by small batteriesor even rely on autonoumus
        energy scavenging techniques.Facilitating this trend, the Bluetooth SIG has
        recently pub-lished a low energy extension that allows short range commu-nication
        with very low power consumption [1]. Bluetooth lowenergy also operates in
        the 2.4 GHz ISM band but with fewerchannels at an increased spacing of 2 MHz.
        The modulationtype is frequency shift keying (FSK) with a data rate of1 Mbps
        and a modulation index of 0.5\u00b110%. The standarddemands for receiver sensitivity
        of -70 dBm or better. Thistranslates into a tolerable noise figure (NF) of
        24 dB assuminga bandwidth of 1 MHz and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of20
        dB.This paper presents a transceiver architecture intended forthe new standard.
        In section II the transceiver architecture ispresented while section III describes
        the circuit level imple-mentation of the blocks. Finally, simulation results
        are givenin section IV.II. ARCHITECTUREIn order to increase the battery life
        time of the sensor nodethe power consumption of the transceiver must be reducedas
        much as possible. As a consequence the direct conversionarchitecture is often
        used for this kind of short-range wirelessapplications [2]\u2013[4]. There
        is just one step of frequencyconversion and so there are few blocks working
        at the radiofrequency.The block diagram of the proposed low power transceiveris
        shown in Fig. 1. The low requirements on the noiseperformance imposed by the
        Bluetooth low energy standardallow to use a passive receiving path. Signal
        amplification isPassive mixer PA 0\u00b090\u00b0BBoutIBBoutQTx-dataLOQLOIQVCOFig.
        1. Block diagram of the proposed transceivershifted completely into the baseband
        where it can be realizedwith less power consumption. The noise figure of this
        approachis defined by the losses in the passive down-conversion andthe noise
        performance of the baseband amplifier.A quadrature voltage controlled oscillator
        (QVCO) gener-ates the I and Q phases of the carrier frequency and directlydrives
        the switches of the passive mixer. In this setup thecapacitive load of the
        mixer is tuned out by the inductor ofthe LC-QVCO [4], [5].The transmitting
        path is also reduced to the minimum num-ber of blocks. The FSK modulation
        defined by the Bluetoothlow energy standard allows direct modulation of the
        VCO.The required frequency deviation of \u00b1225 . . . 275 kHz canbe realized
        using small-sized PMOS transistors as varactors[6]. Direct modulation of the
        QVCO makes an up-conversionmixer unnecessary and the constant envelope transmit
        signalallows an efficient nonlinear power amplifier.Switching type class-E
        power amplifiers are known fortheir very good efficiency. Losses are minimized
        because thecurrent peaks in the switching transistor occur when the drain-source
        voltage is almost zero. Moreover, class-E configurationachieves high efficiency
        because the drain voltage can ideallyrise up to 3.56 times the supply voltage
        [7]. However, in orderto operate the power amplifier in class-E mode for low
        outputpower levels of about 0 dBm the load resistance seen by thePA must be
        approximately 1 k\u2126. Therefore, a transformer isused to boost the antenna
        impedance. The transformer alsoprovides single-ended to differential conversion
        if a single-ended antenna is used. Differential PAs generate smallercurrent
        peaks on the supply line than single-ended PAs, andsuch peaks appear at twice
        the operating frequency. Thisfacilitates the decoupling of the PA from the

        is also benefi-cial for the receiver design because it provides passive voltagegain
        and the switches of the passive mixer can have a higheron-resistance.III.
        IMPLEMENTATIONThe transceiver front-end has been designed in a 130 nmRF CMOS
        process using 6 metal layers (1 thick top metal)and MIM capacitors. The supply
        voltage is set to 1.0 V.A. TransformerImpedance transformation is achieved
        using a step-up trans-former with a 2-turn coil at the antenna port and a
        6-turn coilat the internal port In order to minimize the insertion lossthe
        coupling factor k between the coils has to be maximized[8]. Therefore, the
        coil connected to the antenna consists oftwo parallel windings of two turns
        each. This also reduces theserial resistance in this coil. On the internally
        connected coil ahigh inductance is needed to support the high impedance levelon
        this port. The transformer is drawn as a planar structureusing the thick top
        metal layer 6 and the thin metal layer 5 ofthe process.Characterization of
        the electrical behavior has been withthe 2.5-D electromagnetic solver Momentum.
        The resulting s-parameter set was then fitted to a direct form model of thetransformer
        [8] with the most important parameters presentedin Table I.B. QVCO with direct
        modulationThe QVCO is based on a previous work [9] using parallelcoupling.
        Thanks to the high differential inductance of 10.2 nHin each tank it achieves
        an amplitude of 0.2 V at the fouroutput I\/Q phases with a very low current
        consumption ofapproximately 350 \u00b5A.During transmission mode only the
        in-phase component ofthe carrier is needed and therefore one core of the QVCO
        isdeactivated. In this mode the QVCO is also used to directlygenerate the
        FSK modulation of the carrier. The high tankinductance leads to a differential
        capacitance of only 170 aFthat has to be switched. Such a small switchable
        capacitancecan be implemented using almost minimum sized PMOStransistors as
        varactors with digital control voltage [6].In order to obtain a positive and
        negative frequency devia-tion from the carrier simply two differential varactors
        are usedvminusmod[0]mod[1]vplusFig. 2. PMOS varactor pair used for direct

        class-E power amplifierin parallel (Fig 2). Setting both modulation inputs
        (mod[0:1])to VDD leads to the higher differential capacitance and henceto
        a negative frequency deviation. On the other hand, settingboth inputs to ground
        results in a positive frequency shift. Theintermediate state with one input
        at ground and one at VDD isneeded to tune the VCO to the center frequency
        within a phaselocked loop (PLL). During transmission the PLL is opened toallow
        direct modulation of the VCO.The accuracy of the frequency shift heavily depends
        on theprocess variation, i.e. the offset frequency varies as much as\u00b125%.
        Therefore, an array of 5 differential varactor pairs hasto be added to the
        LC tank in order to select the pair with thedesired frequency shift by calibration.
        Within the industrialtemperature range of -40\u00b0C. . . 85\u00b0C the variation
        fortunatelyis much smaller (\u2248 \u00b12%) so that no further calibration
        versustemperature is needed.C. Power amplifierThe proposed differential power
        amplifier is shown in Fig. 3together with the Tx\/Rx-switch. The thin oxide
        output tran-sistor M1 and M2 are driven by inverters and thus operate asswitches.
        If all parallel stages are actived the power amplifierworks in class-E mode
        and achieves its peak efficiency andhighest output power level. The concept
        of 4 stages in parallelhas the advantage that for a reduced output power setting
        alsothe power consumption in the drivers is reduced.The Tx\/Rx switch uses
        thick oxide transistors in order towithstand the class-E voltage waveforms

        4. Passive current-driven mixer with baseband transimpedance amplifiertheir
        drains. Also in case of an ESD event the voltage at thispoints can rise up
        to three times higher than at the antennainput due to the impedance conversion
        of the transformer.D. ReceiverIn a direct-conversion receiver the low frequency
        1\/f noise isof special concern because the down-converted signal appearsaround
        DC. Since the noise density is proportional to the DCcurrent a passive mixer
        with zero bias current achieves verygood noise performance and a low 1\/f
        corner frequency [10].Therefore, a passive current driven mixer as shown in
        Fig. 4is used in the receiver.The noise performance of the passive mixer itself
        is ba-sically defined by its conversion gain. Due to its passivebehavior the
        conversion gain is always negative and directlyincreases the noise figure
        of the receiver. The conversion gainis improved if the transistors work as
        switches with a low on-resistance. This can be achieved by using wide transistors
        withlarge over drive voltage. However, larger overdrive voltageleads to an
        increased power consumption in the driving QVCOor even requires a buffering
        stage. Low on-resistance can alsobe achieved using wide transistors leading
        to an increasedparasitic coupling capacitance from the mixer input to theQVCO.
        This would make the QVCO more susceptible tofrequency pulling at high RF input
        levels. Therefore, in orderto limit power consumption and VCO pulling the
        implementedpassive mixer is driven by a low amplitude of 0.2 V and usesrelatively
        small transistors.The output of the passive mixer is loaded by the basebandtransimpedance
        amplifier and by a MIM-capacitor (CLP =20pF ) to remove the RF components.
        The amplifier presentsa low impedance load (\u2248 500k\u2126) to the mixer
        and convertsthe input current to an output voltage with a gain of Rfb =15k\u2126.
        Parallel feedback capacitors Cfb form together withthe freedback resistors
        Rfb the channel filter with a low passcorner frequency of 650 kHz.The operational
        amplifier contains a differential PMOS pairfor amplification followed by a
        buffering stage to drive the loadwhich is mainly formed by the feedback network.
        Each stageworks with a bias current of approximately 100 \u00b5A resulting
        ina total current consumption of 210 \u00b5A per baseband amplifierincluding
        biasing and common mode feedback. The commonmode voltage at the input and

        with a differential100 \u2126 antenna including parasitics extracted from
        the layout(Fig. 5) using the SpectreRF simulator. ESD structures and aQFN36
        package model have also been included in the simula-tion to account for losses
        in the antenna IOs. At the basebandoutputs the amplifiers are loaded by 100
        fF capacitors toaccount for the load imposed by subsequent stages.The simulated
        power amplifier performance is summarizedin Table II. It shows a peak drain
        efficiency at the highest out-put level setting of 28.4%. Including the power
        consumptionof the QVCO with all its biasing current steered to one of thetwo
        cores, the overall efficiency of the transmitter is expectedto be 24.1%.The

        energy standard. It leads to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.2 dB in each
        baseband channel andtherefore leaves plenty of margin for the FSK demodulator.The
        overall noise figure is plotted in Fig. 7. Below the 1\/fcorner frequency
        of 20 kHz the baseband amplifier dominatesthe noise performance while at higher
        frequencies both thepassive mixer and the baseband amplifier equally contributeto
        the total noise.Fig 8 shows the simulation of the receiver linearity athigh

        architecture has been presentedthat is capable of conforming the Bluetooth

        which allows the design of an efficient class-E poweramplifier for low output
        power levels and a supply of 1.0 V.In the receiver the power consumpton has
        been minimized asmuch as possible while sacrifycing noise performance. Stillthe

        Transformer Uses Coax to\n\r\nAchieve High Turn Ratio and Flat Response \nThe
        problem: \nTo design a high frequency wide-band transformer \nwith a high
        turn ratio, a high coupling coefficient, and \na flat broadband response.
        It is difficult to obtain ef-\nficient coupling in standard high frequency
        trans-\nformers with turn ratios above 2:1. Also, flat broad-\nband frequency
        response is not readily available in \ntransformers with very high turn ratios.\nThe
        solution: \nA toroidal core is spirally wound with a single \ncoaxial cable.
        The inner conductor of the coaxial \ncable functions as the primary winding
        and the outer \ncoax shielding is segmented to form the secondary \nwinding.
        \nHow it\u0027s done: \nA center-tap push-pull transformer configuration \nis
        shown which consists of a helical winding of coaxial \n(continued overleaf)

        ferrite \ninner conductor, with input terminals I and 2, cor-\nresponds to
        the primary winding. The outer shielding, \nwith output terminals 3 and 4,
        corresponds to the \nsecondary winding. \nThe cable is initially wound on
        the core at a 1:1 \nratio. The method used to obtain a 4:1 stepdown ratio
        \nis illustrated. For each half of the transformer I and II \nthere are effectively
        four primary windings magneti-\ncally coupled to one secondary winding. The
        effect of \nreducing the number of turns in the secondary is \naccomplished
        by sectionally discontinuing the outer \nshielding and rewiring the resulting
        sections into \nfour parallel networks. Thus, the secondary is elec-\ntrically
        equivalent to a single turn of a conductor \nabout a magnetic core wound with
        four primary turns. \nNotes: \nI. Specific performance. data of this design
        indicate \nthat the coupling coefficient between primary and \nsecondary approaches
        1. Stray inductance loss is \nlowered by this configuration. The amount of
        \ncoupling and\/or stray inductance loss may be \nvaried as a function of
        the diameters of the two \nconductors.\n2. Empirical study of the frequency
        response of this \ntransformer indicates a completely flat response \nfrom
        100 Kc to 10 Mc. \n3. The networks in parallel need not be single turn as
        \nillustrated, but may be any number as required to \nmeet specific requirements.
